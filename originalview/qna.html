                    <p>
                        Yes! Each PetMeals recipe contains complete a meal that is crafted with whole foods that are considered to be the best for dogs of all age groups and weight. Feeding your dog the best quality human grade food is the best thing that you can do as a responsible pet parent as it will keep your dog healthy and happy for a longer lifespan.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">I ALREADY GIVE HOME COOKED MEALS TO MY DOG. WHY SHOULD I BUY PETMEALS?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Research shows that about 80-90% of the home prepared meals that are given to pets are not completely balanced for their nutritional needs. Home prepared food for pets is especially deficient in proteins, vitamins, minerals and amino acids – all of which are critical for the health of your pet.

                            If you do want to give your pet your own home cooked meals, we would recommend that you make the meals separately for your pet with their complete nutritional requirements in mind. Never give them the food that is cooked for your family as it contains spices and fats that are not recommended for pets.

                            Alternatively, you can go for PetMeals – the most convenient and tasty way to provide complete nutrition to your pet.</p>

                        <button class="accordion">HOW DO I MAKE THE PAYMENT?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>We currently accept only Paytm and online bank transfer. We are in the process of getting the payment gateway integrated to facilitate credit card and debit card payments as well.</p>

                        <button class="accordion">HOW LONG BEFORE MY PETMEALS ORDER IS PROCESSED AND I START GETTING DELIVERIES?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Deliveries are done once a week and delivery days are fixed location wise. In most cases you will receive the order in the next delivery cycle of your area. However in some cases we are willing to make an exception for the first order and not make your pooch wait too long to get a taste of PetMeals. In such cases we would make an off-route delivery as well.</p>

                            <p>Yes! As of now we are covering only Delhi NCR for home deliveries. Your delivery will reach you on a fixed day every week.</p>

                        <button class="accordion">IS THERE A PARTICULAR ORDER IN WHICH TO SERVE THE RECIPES TO MY DOG?</button>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>No! It is completely your choice. You can choose to give the same recipe till you finish all the packets of the same and then move to a new one or keep alternating. It is your and your pet’s choice.</p>

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Each meal pack contains the exact amount that you should feed your dog in every meal. The amount of food that you should feed your dog has been determined based on the weight of the dog that you have mentioned and the nutritional requirement of the particular weight of healthy dog. Every meal should therefore constitute of a complete packet.</p>
